# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

TEMPLATE_TOP=$(EPICS_BASE)/templates/makeBaseApp/top

# Developers: Do not edit the locations in this file!
#
# Create a file RELEASE.local pointing to your dependencies
# and EPICS_BASE directories, e.g.
#   MCOREUTILS = /home/install/epics/mcoreutils
#   EPICS_BASE = /home/install/epics/base

MCOREUTILS = $(TOP)/..

# If used as a standalone TOP, use these includes
#-include $(TOP)/../RELEASE.local
#-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local

# If used as an embedded TOP, use these includes
-include $(TOP)/../../RELEASE.local
-include $(TOP)/../configure/RELEASE.local
